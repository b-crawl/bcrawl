Alistair's Intoxication spell

Converts a small portion of the brain matter of those around you into alcohol,
confusing all intelligent humanoids within view (although poison-resistant
creatures may resist the effects). The caster may experience vertigo briefly
as a result of making contact with other minds. It is frequently used as an
icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Animate Dead spell

Reanimates all corpses and skeletons in the vicinity as followers. This magic
is unstable, so eventually those reanimated will crumble to dust. Zombies and
skeletons cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%

Creates a magical link with a creature and transfers raw necromantic energy,
injuring it. If successful, the caster suffers minor damage from the backlash.

If a living creature is killed by this, it is reanimated as a zombie.

%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
decreases their health to a degree inversely related to power.

It is powerful enough to cancel the effects of Death's Door, although doing so
will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.
%%%%
Borgnjor's Vile Clutch spell

Calls forth hands from corpses interred beneath the dungeon floor long ago.
Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they
break free. It cannot affect enemies that are flying, swimming in deep water,

wildly and are usually, but not always, positive.

morale. They have no noticeable effect.
%%%%

Chain of Chaos spell

Creates an arc of pure chaos, striking nearby creatures with unpredictable
effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.
%%%%
Chain Lightning spell

Releases a massive electrical discharge that arcs from target to target until
it grounds out. Each arc to a target produces an explosion of electricity.

The spell protects the caster from being targeted by the discharge, but not
from its explosions.

The discharge may ground out harmlessly if there are no targets
sufficiently close to the caster. Also, its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Chaos Breath spell

Exhales a large cloud of fumes filled with the very essence of chaos.
%%%%
Chilling Breath spell

Exhales a blast of frost that cannot be dodged or blocked. The range of the
blast is decreased by one for every creature it strikes.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

<Cleansing Flame ability>
%%%%
Cloud Cone spell

Blasts the area near the caster with destructive clouds. At low power, the most
lethal clouds that can be created are noxious fumes. As power increases, this
gives way to roaring flames, freezing vapours, and poisonous gas. At the
highest tiers of power storm clouds, acidic fog and clouds of negative energy
become available.
%%%%
Cold Breath spell

Exhales a focused blast of icy-cold air. It may knock back airborne targets.
The range of the blast is decreased by one for every creature it strikes.
%%%%
Confuse spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind.
%%%%
Confusing Touch spell

Enchants the caster's hands with magical energy that can briefly confuse foes when striking them.
This effect requires both hands, and cannot be used with a weapon or shield.
It becomes more effective as the user gains experience, and is less effective against more powerful foes.

The glow from this spell makes the caster significantly less stealthy.
%%%%
Confusion Gaze spell

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. Casters are advised to use caution;
the lightning is not mindful of what it may hit.

A link to the caster is needed to keep ball lightning cohesive, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if they drift out of view.

While ball lightning is not intelligent, it can be directed to some extent
by the caster.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

Creates a blazing column of magical flame in a targeted empty location.
%%%%
Controlled Blink spell

Translocates the caster with precise control; the distance increases
with power. Be wary: controlled translocations cause
significant magical contamination.
%%%%
Corona spell

Causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature.
This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot spell

Rapidly accelerates the decomposition of any corpses lying around the caster,
emitting in the process a foul miasmic vapour, which eats away at the life
force of any creature it envelops.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid. The range of the bolt is decreased by one for
every creature it strikes.
%%%%
Corrupting Pulse spell

Instills a corruption within all visible targets, temporarily mutating their
bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the
undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Crystal Bolt spell

Projects a penetrating projectile with peculiar magical properties. It is
randomly imbued with either fire or ice, and additionally will reflect from
walls of any material due to the crystal embedded in the shot. The range of the
bolt is decreased by one for every creature it strikes.
%%%%
Darkness spell

Dims the light of the dungeon, reducing the range of vision.
%%%%
Dazzling Orbs spell

Fires three globs of brightly glowing magical energy that are easily dodged and deal no damage but
will stick to and illuminate any creature they hit, obstructing its vision if it relies on light to see.
At high power, the effect duration increases but the accuracy of the globs does not.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

Raises living creatures slain by the caster and their allies, reducing them to
a state of spectral slavery.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left more resilient when the effect ends. It has no effect on those who
are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

Protects the caster from all kinds of projectile attacks, making them
significantly easier to dodge. It is highly effective against both
single-target and penetrating attacks.

The spell is linked to the caster's magical reserves, and may drain
magic when a missile is deflected. The efficiency of the shield increases
at higher spell power.

To be cancelled, this spell must be carefully cast again in reverse.
%%%%
Dig spell

Digs a tunnel through unworked rock.
%%%%
Dimension Anchor spell

Blocks any translocations attempted by the affected target, be they voluntary
or not. This includes even some cross-plane effects, although notably not
Banishment.
%%%%

Drives nearby creatures into an insane frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disintegrate spell

Violently rends apart anything in a small volume of space. It can be used to
cause severe damage, or remove a chunk of rock.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature that resists the effect will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a chance of being confused by
the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.
%%%%

}} The caster becomes much more robust and able to deal incredible damage in melee combat,
and their magical spells become more powerful, but they become easier to hit because of a dragon's enormous size.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.

With seven bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon

a short time or on the death of the caster. This cannot kill directly, and is

Breathes a blast of fire that leaves a cloud of flames at its endpoint.
%%%%

it engulfs.

thrown monster nearby.
%%%%

portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.

unscathed by it.
%%%%
Hurl Hellfire spell

dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.

form cannot move or teleport, and cannot be cancelled at will.

While transformed, any equipped armour except shields is melded.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

Transforms the caster into a frozen ice-creature, light enough to float on
water. The caster gains a powerful freezing melee attack,
and becomes resistant to cold, poison, and hostile enchantments,
but becomes more vulnerable to fire.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.

With four bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Icicle Burst spell

A modified version of Throw Icicle, this spell launches several shards of ice, sacrificing accuracy and armour penetration to maximize destructive power.

wasps may be created.

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It heavily deforms
its targets, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected: their magic is destabilized, and casting further spells
shortly afterwards will increase the risk of their spells failing. Also, some
of the magic lingers, enough to leave the caster dangerously contaminated after
several castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy linked to the caster's own magical
reserves. While the battlesphere cannot take independent action, it will fire
volleys of energy at the caster's enemies in sync with its creator's own
destructive conjurations. With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer
and deals more damage per volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy.

increases with the distance it travels. Such explosions will not travel backwards
directly towards the source of the sphere.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and attempts to attack
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is
strongly reduced by armour.

targets will cause a small but more damaging explosion, and targets made from
crystal will cause a large and more damaging explosion.

With at least 7 bars of power, this spell can destroy stone walls.
Crystal walls are brittle and may be destroyed at any power level.

unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound

expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.
%%%%
Malmutate spell

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.
%%%%
Mana Rupture spell

Destabilizes the target's natural flow of magic, creating an explosion of unstable magic proportional in strength to the target's resistance to enchantments. Targets not completely immune to enchantments will become more vulnerable to them, if they survive.

When cast on summoned creatures, this spell instantly destroys them instead of creating an explosion.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures up a short-lived cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.

caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%

all those who are not resistant to cold. Those especially vulnerable to cold
will be affected much more strongly, and tougher creatures will be slowed for a

Fires a directed stream of sharp metal splinters. Its damage is strongly
reduced by armour. The range of the stream is decreased by one for every
creature it strikes.
%%%%

creatures it touches.
%%%%

Significally increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%
Might spell

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid. It may call forth a
harpy, manticore or lindwurm, and at high power may summon a sphinx, or an
entire pack of harpies. With high power the individual creatures will also gain
increased strength.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

Transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal figure. The caster
becomes more resistant to cold and hostile enchantments and completely immune
to poison, rotting, negative energy and torment, and requires no food at all
for the duration of the spell. The caster's necromancy spells are increased in
power, and they gain a draining melee attack. The caster also gains some of the
more dubious benefits of having an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy
damage and Dispel Undead, and an inability to consume potions.

With eight bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything nearby for as long as the spell lasts. It is less effective against
strong foes.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a freezing cloud of ice for a short time,
granting a bonus to armour and freezing melee attackers that hit or are blocked.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Drains heat from the caster and their surroundings, causing harm to all
creatures not resistant to cold and bypassing any armour the targets may have.
It prevents the caster from using potions for a brief duration.
%%%%
Pain spell

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The caster
suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

Irresistably prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time,
requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time, but a gateway
will close when entered, or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock.
It takes some time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which they will
be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature. If successful, the target is slowed down for a
while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, the target will
take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Piercing Shot spell

Allows the caster to fire or throw missiles through any targets they hit,
potentially hitting everything in their path until they reach their maximum
range. These missiles also bypass shields. Each missile thrown or fired
in this way consumes a further 2 MP.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest,
the Swamp, the Shoals, the Pits of Slime, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, the
Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the specific branch varies
with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. It can
poison even creatures resistant to poison, and the arrow will do some
physical damage.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature poisonous. At high power, the
poisonous cloud will last longer, but it will never last very long.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Allows the caster to teleport fired or thrown missiles directly to their
targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for
each missile. Teleported projectiles have their accuracy greatly increased.
%%%%
Primal Wave spell

Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a
pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%
Random Bolt spell

Fires, at random, a bolt of venom, negative energy, fire, cold, dispelling
energy, electricity, or acid.
%%%%
Recall spell

Recalls any friendly creatures on the same level to a position adjacent to the
caster, over a short duration.
%%%%
Regeneration spell

Reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unnatural act dramatically but
temporarily increases the caster's health regeneration, while also speeding
their metabolism.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks. Each time a missile is repelled the spell has a chance of
expiring, with a lower chance of expiry at high power.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Ring of Thunder spell

Surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of highly-damaging thunderclouds.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Consumes ten stones to create a short blast of high-velocity rock shards. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition may cause the target to lose control over their
magic, progressively hindering their chances of success as more spells are
cast.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Scorpion Form spell

Transforms the caster into a giant scorpion. The caster becomes more robust,
very resistant to fire, resistant to poison and acid, and gains a powerful
venomous stinger.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded. Casting spells
becomes slightly more difficult, but poison magic becomes more powerful.

With seven bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. Though
initially mild, so long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and
supplies it with magical power (by waiting in place and not taking any other
actions), the ray will grow in strength until it becomes a surging bolt able to
tear clean through the ranks of the caster's foes.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of dragonfire that burns away some of
the fire resistance of those it strikes.
It leaves a cloud of flames at its endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Shackle spell

Magically chains a creature to the ground, seafloor, or other surface below
it, preventing it from leaving its tile. Unlike paralysis, this does not
prevent the creature from taking other actions, nor does it impair the
creature's evasion.

The shackles are not strong enough to prevent creatures from blinking or
teleporting, but they will follow a creature that does so and bind them to
their new location. Some insubstantial and gelatinous creatures are immune
to this spell.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Sheza's Dance spell

Summons weapons from far and wide - a dagger newly forged, a sword long-rusted
in a moldering tomb, an axe still steaming with the blood of its victim -
animating them and sending them out to attack.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Shroud of Golubria spell

Bends space around the caster's body, protecting them from some blows by
redirecting their force to the air nearby. Ranged attacks cannot be diverted in
this way. The shroud is highly unstable, and may fall apart unexpectedly under
stress.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Creates an icy replica from the corpse of the original being. This magic is
unstable, so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud.
Simulacra cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

Smites any targeted enemy within sight, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Song of Slaying spell

Recites ancient verses of battle. Each non-summoned enemy the caster slays in
combat during this recitation temporarily enhances their melee and ranged
skills. The bonus only lasts for the duration of the song; casting this spell
while already singing will start a new song, not extend an existing one.

As the song grows in power, if the caster is not wielding a shield, they can use
the sound itself as one.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spectral Weapon spell

Draws out the spirit within a wielded weapon to fight for the caster, with its
strength increasing with power. It only attacks when the caster does, and its
kills count as the caster's own. Only one spectral weapon can be maintained
at a time, and only while the original weapon remains wielded.

If the weapon is damaged, part of the injury will be echoed on the caster's body.
Spirits drawn from stronger weapons will be tougher as well as more damaging,
while those from faster weapons will be more evasive.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be affected, and any abilities that
require evocation skill to trigger will not be active.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing whichever type of
destructive magic its creator is most skilled with, though the strongest of magics cannot be imbued into it.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

Transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. The caster becomes
highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and casting
spells becomes slightly more difficult.

With three bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Causes chaotic movement of electrical charges around up to two creatures
adjacent to the caster. These discharges will arc to up to two adjacent targets
before grounding out. Damage from these discharges bypasses armour, and is
slightly reduced when arcing to the caster. The damage dealt increases with the
spell's power, but its other properties are unaffected.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

Transforms the caster into a slow but extremely robust stone statue. The
caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially
increased. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, rotting and negative energy.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.

With six bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature. The range of the ball
is decreased by one for every creature it strikes.
%%%%
Steam Barrier spell

Causes the caster's body to emit strangely viscous steam, providing some resistance to attacks and fire,
but inhibits their spell power and makes them more susceptible to cold.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes spell

Transforms a number of arrows in inventory into short-lived snakes, creating
more dangerous snakes with higher power. Each snake costs ten arrows.
%%%%
Sticky Flame Range spell

Launches a glob of sticky flame, covering a targeted creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Conjures a glob of sticky flame, covering an adjacent creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a tornado from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration to
maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Fires a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Strip Resistance spell

Greatly reduces the target's magic resistance, making them more vulnerable to
hostile enchantments.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

Converts some of the caster's blood into magical energy. The process is painful
but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%
Summon Air Elementals spell

Summons one or more air elementals.
%%%%
Summon Butterflies spell

Creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%
Summon Demon spell

Opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its inhabitants
to serve the caster for a time. The demon's servitude is not guaranteed, but
will be more likely with high power.
%%%%
Summon Dragon spell

Summons and binds a powerful dragon to perform the caster's bidding. At high
power it may summon particularly deadly varieties of dragon, or multiple lesser
dragons at once.

to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,
and the trees of the forest will be awakened to deal damage to nearby enemies.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster. With
high power, the summoned demon will be less likely to be initially hostile —
but the strongest demons may eventually turn against their summoner regardless.
%%%%
Summon Guardian Golem spell

Summons a protective golem. It redirects the injuries of its allies (but not
the caster) to itself. When sufficiently damaged, it may fill with an inner
flame, causing it to explode if destroyed. It gains more health at high power.
%%%%
Summon Hell Beast spell

Summons a deadly hell beast.
%%%%
Summon Holies spell

Calls forth divine warriors to aid the caster.

of electricity at the caster's foes, but is completely immobile.

%%%%
Throw Icicle spell

Fires a shard of ice. Due to its strong impact and cutting edges, a
significant portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Time Stop spell

Contrary to the name, this spell merely speeds up the caster's mind and flow of magical power by several hundred times. This acceleration can only handle a limited amount of power, so it only works for spells of level 4 or lower. Also, the caster cannot gain mana or reduce spell costs while this effect is active.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in
their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They
are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.
%%%%
Tornado spell

Turns the air around the caster into a mighty vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and
tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the
caster. The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After
the tornado fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

Animates the weapon of a targeted foe, ripping it from their hands and causing

%%%%
Vortex spell

Turns the air near the caster into a mighty, short-lived vortex, doing
tremendous damage to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept
up into the air and tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place,
and it follows the caster. After the vortex fades, it cannot be called forth
again for a short time.
%%%%
Wall of Brambles spell

Causes brambles to rapidly grow nearby. They have almost no structural
strength, but the wicked thorns they bear make their removal difficult. Such
brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.
%%%%
Warning Cry spell

Generates a loud noise, alerting nearby enemies.
%%%%
Waterstrike spell

Causes the water around or under the target to violently swirl, dealing damage.
It can affect targets standing in or flying above water.
