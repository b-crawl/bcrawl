finishing a recitation, it cannot be repeated for a short time.

The recitation will have different effects depending on the target: the chaotic
and unclean will be affected by powerful and damaging effects, undead and

skill.
%%%%
Enslave Soul ability

Marks a monster's soul as ripe for the taking. Intelligent living, holy and
demonic monsters can be targeted (excepting most lords of Pandemonium), as
long as they are relatively uninjured. The duration of the mark is dependent on
Invocations skill. If the monster dies while still marked, its soul will become
yours.

The enslaved soul will retain the monster's faculties, equipment and abilities,

will be briefly slowed and occasionally may even pass out, and will be unable
to berserk again for a short time.
%%%%

is effective even on those who would not otherwise be able to regenerate. While

enchantments.
%%%%

%%%%
# Elyvilon
Divine Protection ability

Beseeches Elyvilon to save your life. If you are mortally wounded, the Healer
may undo the killing blow. Especially pious individuals may be certain of this
help, but in that case, any intervention costs piety (as opposed to merely
asking for intervention, which is always free). Killing others while asking
for divine protection will cause penance.
%%%%
Lesser Healing ability

Heals a moderate amount of health, increasing with Invocations skill.
%%%%
Purification ability

Purges your body of negative effects such as poison, confusion, slowness,
petrification, rotting, and sickness, and fully restores any lost strength,
dexterity or intelligence.
%%%%
Heal Other ability

Heals a creature other than yourself by a moderate amount, depending on
Invocations skill. Using this ability on hostile monsters will try to turn them
neutral. This works best on animals, and is less effective on humanoids and
other intelligent creatures. Undead and demons are harder still to pacify.
Ghosts of dead adventurers and demon lords are too wrathful to be pacified,
mindless creatures are too unintelligent to be pacified, and no monster can be
pacified while it is asleep.

Whether the pacification succeeds or not, the invested food, piety and magic
points are lost. If it does succeed, the monster is healed and you gain half
the monster's experience value. Otherwise, the monster is unaffected and you
gain nothing.
%%%%
Greater Healing ability

Heals a significant amount of health, increasing with Invocations skill. Greater
Healing will heal approximately twice as much as Lesser Healing, at approximately
four times the piety cost.
%%%%

Invocations skill. Your current health and magic points will also be increased
proportionally.

Transports you out of the Abyss, returning you to the location from which you
entered it.
%%%%
Bend Space ability

Bends the fabric of space, instantly translocating the user a short distance,

warping the fabric of space, this ability ignores effects that would usually
prevent translocations. Invocations skill increases the chance of affecting
nearby creatures and the damage dealt to those affected.
%%%%
Banish ability

Attempts to banish a creature into the Abyss. If the attempt succeeds, you gain
some piety and half the creature's experience value. Invocations skill makes it
harder to resist.
%%%%
Corrupt ability

Corrupts the current level by unleashing Abyssal energies on it. This will
cause the area nearby to change appearance, and will gate in creatures from the
Abyss bent on causing destruction. This will not work on levels already
corrupted or in the Abyss itself. The size of the effect is increased by
Invocations skill.
%%%%
Enter the Abyss ability

Transports you to Lugonu's realm instantly. The effort of even using the
ability will leave your health depleted.
%%%%

distortion. This blessing may only be used once, and it cannot be used on
artefact weapons.

# Fedhas

granting no experience.
%%%%

the light will be easier to hit. Water affected by the sunlight will evaporate.
In particular, deep water will become shallow water, and shallow water will dry
up completely, revealing the dungeon floor.
%%%%
Growth ability

Grows a ring of plants around yourself.
The plants you create gain bonus health proportional to your Invocations skill.
%%%%
Rain ability

explode, causing damage to you or your enemies.

while you're gone.

are permanently invisible and are immune to poison, draining, torment, and
hostile enchantments. All incoming damage will be halved, and you will bleed

with ranged attacks will be halved, your spellcasting power will be greatly
hampered, and your skills will be further drained when taking damage.
Invocations skill increases the duration of the transformation.

three lists at a time, with varying prices.
%%%%
Call Merchant ability

    if you.race() == "Mummy" then
        return

    local desc = " You will always have the option to fund a shop selling "

    if you.race() == "Ghoul" then
        desc = desc .. "carrion"
    elseif you.race() == "Vampire" then
        desc = desc .. "blood"
    else
        desc = desc .. "food"
    end

    desc = desc .. "."

    return desc
}}
%%%%
Bribe Branch ability

Gives 3000 gold to Gozag to spread throughout the inhabitants of the current
branch, only possible if the branch has intelligent inhabitants. Those monsters
may then become uninterested in fighting you (with tougher inhabitants having
an increasing chance of being bribed), and more rarely will join your ranks,
though they will not leave their home branch. Enemies accepting a bribe will
lower the remaining bribe fund; upon its exhaustion, bribed enemies will become
indifferent if they have not become your allies.
%%%%
# Pakellas
Device Surge ability

said god).

Serpent's Lash ability

never miss, and can pin enemies. This ability drains you an amount that decreases
with your current piety.
%%%%

Using martial attacks increases the storm's duration, and while the storm rages,
you gain a bonus to melee damage and accuracy proportional to the storm's remaining
duration.

ability, you will be unable to hop again until you have spent some time not
