  - v1.24: Weapons show their base damage adjusted by player strength and skills.
  - v1.24.1: Adjusted unarmed damage is shown on the % screen.
  - v1.26: Scoring is changed: scores are now ((2.75\*10^11 * sqrt(runes) * (1 + wins) + 3.36\*10^7 * sqrt(experience)) / (turns + 1000)); "wins" is 1 for winning games, and 0 otherwise.
  - v1.26.1: Portals and shops no longer have a (small) chance to randomly be mimics.
  - v1.27.3: Players can inspect full item stacks in view, not just the top item.

  - v1.20: Magic contamination decreases twice as fast when at full mana and not glowing.

  - v1.23: Monsters immune to drowning are still silenced by being engulfed by water. (This makes phials of floods better against liches.)
  - v1.23: Shield penalty is multiplied by (8 / (8 + shield_skill)) instead of subtracting skill from shield penalty. This reduction is shown in shield descriptions.
  - v1.23.2: Tree form is giant size, which means potions of lignification break constriction if the source is not giant.
  - v1.23.2: Unbreathing players are not protected from being silenced by being engulfed by water.
  - v1.23.2: Player size increasing can break engulf like how it can break constriction.
  - v1.23.2: Players have double the regeneration rate of health and mana while waiting, except in Hell branches. This represents first aid or meditation, and unlike normal regeneration is not adjusted by time per turn or temporary statuses.
  - v1.23.4: Monster smite damage (such as from orc priests) is changed from 7-17 to 10-12.
  - v1.24.1: The bonus damage % from flaming, freezing, vorpal, and holy wrath brands is no longer randomized, to make branded weapon variance more consistent with unbranded attacks.
  - v1.24.3: Vorpal melee weapons have a minimum bonus damage of (1 + current_mana/25).
  - v1.24.3: Flaming, freezing, and draining brands deal 1/3 more bonus damage. Vorpal brands on ranged weapons deal 1/3 more bonus damage.
  - v1.24.3: Antimagic branded weapons reduce player max mana by 1/2 instead of 2/3.
  - v1.24.3: Unarmed attacks in normal form have higher base accuracy. Claws no longer increase unarmed accuracy. Some transmutation forms have a smaller bonus to unarmed accuracy.
  - v1.25: Unarmed attack speed is changed to (27 / (27 + skill)). This change has no effect at 0 skill or max skill, but increases attack speed by ~12% at 13 skill. This is compensation for the shield penalty rework, for weapon brand buffs, for reduced accuracy of some transmutation forms, and for shorter branches.
  - v1.27: Spell hunger no longer depends on intelligence. The new formula is (135*(level - 1) - 40*spellcasting).
  - v1.27: Hunger adjustments: waiting a turn still costs 3 nutrition, but now regenerating mana is +3, attacks are +27 per 10 auts, rations and chunks give +10% nutrition, and the difference between "hungry" and "very hungry" is larger.
  - v1.27.2: The "MP-powered wands" mutation gives a larger (+1/3 -> +1/2) power bonus.
  - v1.27.8: Storm clouds deal significantly more damage.

  - v1.34.2: Monsters can't attack immediately after Blink Allies Encircling.
  - v1.34.3: Demons and holy creatures can go berserk.
  - v1.35.1: Archmagi can stack up to 2.
  - v1.36: Weapon damage scaling with strength is simplified to (26 + strength)/36.
  - v1.36: Short blade damage scales with dexterity instead of strength.
  - v1.36: Inner flame explosions no longer anger allies.
  - v1.36.2: Monster breath attacks have a timeout of 2 to 5 turns instead of 1 to 5 turns.
  - v1.36.5: Guaranteed damage reduction (GDR) calculation is reworked. It's now normally proportional to sqrt(dexterity + armour_skill).
  - v1.37.1: Base health regeneration of players is now 0.1 + HP/600 per turn. This is higher than before at low levels.
  - v1.39.2: The chance of player aux melee attacks is now scaled by (25 + dexterity \* 2.5)% instead of by ((strength + dexterity) \* 2)%.
  - v1.40.2: Large explosions are more circular.

  - v1.29: Ents are large, have plant resistances, +40% HP, and high natural AC. They have an innate Passwall ability that can also go through trees, and can use 2-handed weapons (other than giant clubs) with a shield. They also have an unarmed damage bonus equivalent to 1.5 levels of claws. However, they take 1.4x as long to do all actions, can't transform, can't train Necromancy, and can't wear body armour.

It only works while unarmed without a shield, and has a chance based on your level and enemy HD to confuse hit enemies for 1 to 2 turns. It does not prevent players from dealing melee damage, and does not end when it affects an enemy. Currently, it's exclusive to Martial Artists.
  - v1.39.2: Scorpion Form (L7 Transmutations/Poison) turns the player into a giant scorpion with a powerful stinger aux attack, rPois, +20% HP, and good AC. This form also has a small penalty to spell success and increases spell power (+1 enhancer level) of poison magic.
