  - v1.14.2: Monsters stepping on visible alarm traps will mark the player.
  - v1.18: New default macros: 'p' = melee attack; '[' = melee attack if in range, otherwise throw; ']' = 3x '['.
  - v1.18.1: New default macros: ';' = rest; '"' = ';'.
  - v1.19.2: Taking stairs upwards when no monsters are visible will never teleport players.
  - v1.20: New default macros: '_' = create path around a pillar; space = walk along path. (by marksg07)
  - v1.20: Guaranteed damage reduction percent is shown always, not just in wizmode.
  - v1.24: Weapons show their base damage adjusted by player strength and skills.
  - v1.24.1: Adjusted unarmed damage is shown on the % screen.
  - v1.26: Scoring is changed: scores are now ((2.75\*10^11 * sqrt(runes) * (1 + wins) + 3.36\*10^7 * sqrt(experience)) / (turns + 1000)); "wins" is 1 for winning games, and 0 otherwise.
  - v1.26.1: Portals and shops no longer have a (small) chance to randomly be mimics.
  - v1.27.3: Players can inspect full item stacks in view, not just the top item.

  - v1.34.1: Players get a message any time they take stairs and a teleport *could* have happened.

#### Balance Changes
  - The Paralyse spell duration is reduced to 2-4 turns.
  - Plain unidentified weapons are always +0.
  - Long Blades now give +SH instead of a chance to riposte.
  - v1.4.1: Distortion weapons can't banish on hit.

  - v1.20: Magic contamination decreases twice as fast when at full mana and not glowing.
  - v1.21.1: Constriction no longer affects blinking. Instead, being constricted gives players a 50% chance to waste scrolls when trying to read them. (There is a warning for this.)
  - v1.23: Monsters immune to drowning are still silenced by being engulfed by water. (This makes phials of floods better against liches.)
  - v1.23: Shield penalty is multiplied by (8 / (8 + shield_skill)) instead of subtracting skill from shield penalty. This reduction is shown in shield descriptions.
  - v1.23.2: Tree form is giant size, which means potions of lignification break constriction if the source is not giant.
  - v1.23.2: Unbreathing players are not protected from being silenced by being engulfed by water.
  - v1.23.2: Player size increasing can break engulf like how it can break constriction.
  - v1.23.2: Players have double the regeneration rate of health and mana while waiting, except in Hell branches. This represents first aid or meditation, and unlike normal regeneration is not adjusted by time per turn or temporary statuses.
  - v1.23.4: Monster smite damage (such as from orc priests) is changed from 7-17 to 10-12.
  - v1.24.1: The bonus damage % from flaming, freezing, vorpal, and holy wrath brands is no longer randomized, to make branded weapon variance more consistent with unbranded attacks.
  - v1.24.3: Vorpal melee weapons have a minimum bonus damage of (1 + current_mana/25).
  - v1.24.3: Flaming, freezing, and draining brands deal 1/3 more bonus damage. Vorpal brands on ranged weapons deal 1/3 more bonus damage.
  - v1.24.3: Antimagic branded weapons reduce player max mana by 1/2 instead of 2/3.
  - v1.24.3: Unarmed attacks in normal form have higher base accuracy. Claws no longer increase unarmed accuracy. Some transmutation forms have a smaller bonus to unarmed accuracy.
  - v1.25: Unarmed attack speed is changed to (27 / (27 + skill)). This change has no effect at 0 skill or max skill, but increases attack speed by ~12% at 13 skill. This is compensation for the shield penalty rework, for weapon brand buffs, for reduced accuracy of some transmutation forms, and for shorter branches.
  - v1.27: Spell hunger no longer depends on intelligence. The new formula is (135*(level - 1) - 40*spellcasting).
  - v1.27: Hunger adjustments: waiting a turn still costs 3 nutrition, but now regenerating mana is +3, attacks are +27 per 10 auts, rations and chunks give +10% nutrition, and the difference between "hungry" and "very hungry" is larger.
  - v1.27.2: The "MP-powered wands" mutation gives a larger (+1/3 -> +1/2) power bonus.
  - v1.27.8: Storm clouds deal significantly more damage.
  - v1.28: Player wisp form has a weaker but electric-branded melee attack, can cast spells, and has reduced spell failure.
  - v1.28.1: Ice form allows cloaks.
  - v1.28.2: Trove entry fees and spawn locations are adjusted.
  - v1.29: Effectiveness of dexterity is no longer stepped down above 18.

  - v1.34: Players gain full experience for all monster deaths, instead of half experience for kills by summons.
  - v1.34.2: Monsters can't attack immediately after Blink Allies Encircling.
  - v1.34.3: Demons and holy creatures can go berserk.
