#### Features
  - All items are automatically identified if the player has a rune.
  - v1.1.1: Like in mainline DCSS, all traps are revealed, but there are no trap effects from exploration.
  - v1.3: To replace traps, when taking stairs there's a 4% chance of being teleported onto the lower floor.
  - v1.7: An "Adventure" mode is added, which is a normal game that starts the player with 2 extra lives.
  - v1.9.3: When in Zot or carrying the Orb, teleports from stairs and traps are replaced by blinks.
  - v1.11: Seeded runs are merged from DCSS.
  - v1.12.1: Taking stairs while on D:1 or D:2 can't teleport players.
  - v1.14.2: Monsters stepping on visible alarm traps will mark the player.
  - v1.18: New default macros: 'p' = melee attack; '[' = melee attack if in range, otherwise throw; ']' = 3x '['.
  - v1.18.1: New default macros: ';' = rest; '"' = ';'.
  - v1.19.2: Taking stairs upwards when no monsters are visible will never teleport players.
  - v1.20: New default macros: '_' = create path around a pillar; space = walk along path. (by marksg07)
  - v1.20: Guaranteed damage reduction percent is shown always, not just in wizmode.
  - v1.24: Weapons show their base damage adjusted by player strength and skills.
  - v1.24.1: Adjusted unarmed damage is shown on the % screen.
  - v1.26: Scoring is changed: scores are now ((2.75*10^11 * sqrt(runes) * (1 + wins) + 3.36*10^7 * sqrt(experience)) / (turns + 1000)); "wins" is 1 for winning games, and 0 otherwise.
  - v1.26.1: Portals and shops no longer have a (small) chance to randomly be mimics.

#### Balance Changes
  - The Paralyse spell duration is reduced to 2-4 turns.
  - Plain unidentified weapons are always +0.
  - Long Blades now give +SH instead of a chance to riposte.
  - v1.4.1: Distortion weapons can't banish on hit.
  - v1.8.6: Starting skills are based on +0 aptitude (-1 for Spellcasting) instead of Human aptitudes.
  - v1.15.1: Guaranteed damage reduction now affects player damage from spells with non-elemental damage.
  - v1.19: The combined effect of wizardry items, Vehumet, and brilliance potions is no longer capped.
  - v1.19.2: Poison on monsters is no longer capped at 4 stacks.
  - v1.20: Magic contamination decreases twice as fast when at full mana and not glowing.
  - v1.21.1: Constriction no longer affects blinking. Instead, being constricted gives players a 50% chance to waste scrolls when trying to read them. (There is a warning for this.)
  - v1.23: Monsters immune to drowning are still silenced by being engulfed by water. (This makes phials of floods better against liches.)
  - v1.23: Shield penalty is multiplied by (8 / (8 + shield_skill)) instead of subtracting skill from shield penalty. This reduction is shown in shield descriptions.
  - v1.23.2: Tree form is giant size, which means potions of lignification break constriction if the source is not giant.
  - v1.23.2: Unbreathing players are not protected from being silenced by being engulfed by water.
  - v1.23.2: Player size increasing can break engulf like how it can break constriction.
  - v1.23.2: Players have double the regeneration rate of health and mana while waiting, except in Hell branches. This represents first aid or meditation, and unlike normal regeneration is not adjusted by time per turn or temporary statuses.
  - v1.23.4: Monster smite damage (such as from orc priests) is changed from 7-17 to 10-12.
  - v1.24.1: The bonus damage % from flaming, freezing, vorpal, and holy wrath brands is no longer randomized, to make branded weapon variance more consistent with unbranded attacks.
  - v1.24.3: Vorpal melee weapons have a minimum bonus damage of (1 + current_mana/25).
  - v1.24.3: Flaming, freezing, and draining brands deal 1/3 more bonus damage. Vorpal brands on ranged weapons deal 1/3 more bonus damage.
  - v1.24.3: Antimagic branded weapons reduce player max mana by 1/2 instead of 2/3.
  - v1.24.3: Unarmed attacks in normal form have higher base accuracy. Claws no longer increase unarmed accuracy. Some transmutation forms have a smaller bonus to unarmed accuracy.
  - v1.25: Unarmed attack speed is changed to (27 / (27 + skill)). This change has no effect at 0 skill or max skill, but increases attack speed by ~12% at 13 skill. This is compensation for the shield penalty rework, for weapon brand buffs, for reduced accuracy of some transmutation forms, and for shorter branches.
  - v1.27: Spell hunger no longer depends on intelligence. The new formula is (135*(level - 1) - 40*spellcasting).
  - v1.27: Hunger adjustments: waiting a turn still costs 3 nutrition, but now regenerating mana is +3, attacks are +27 per 10 auts, rations and chunks give +10% nutrition, and the difference between "hungry" and "very hungry" is larger.

  - Fairy has great magic aptitudes, -1 MP costs on all spells, bonus defenses, and can't wear armour.
  - Sand Dwarf is small, slow, and has no spellcasting penalty in armour.

  - v1.14.2: Flaming Arrows (L2 Charms/Fire) adds bonus damage to ranged attacks, at the cost of 2 MP per projectile.
  - v1.15: Steam Barrier (L6 Charms/Fire) creates steam clouds around the player, gives rF+ and rC-, reduces player spell power (-1 enhancer level), and gives an AC bonus proportional to its remaining duration.
  - v1.21: Confusing Touch is re-added as a very different spell. It only works while unarmed without a shield, and has a chance based on your level and enemy HD to confuse hit enemies for 1 to 2 turns.

  - v1.14.2: Regeneration ends when at max HP.
  - v1.14.2: Spellforged Servitors created by players have one spell, which is the spell from its list of possible spells that the player has the highest spell power for. That spell's power affects the Servitor's strength.
  - v1.15: Spellforged Servitors can have spells that are not in the player's spell list.
  - v1.16: Vampiric Draining has lower base damage but scales more with spell power; above 19 power it will now be better. Also, it can now do more damage than the missing HP of the player, and has a 10% chance of draining 1 strength.

  - v1.22: Song of Slaying now gives +SH equal to twice its slaying bonus if not using a shield.
