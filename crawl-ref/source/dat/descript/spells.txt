as a result of making contact with other minds. It is frequently used as an
icebreaker at wizard parties.

Continuously abjures hostile summoned creatures in the vicinity of the caster.
This reduces their remaining time before being sent back where they came from.
%%%%

the caster in place until they no longer have any nearby allies they can

%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently
lessens their resilience to injury, to a degree dependent on (and inversely

Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they

effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.

Chilling Breath spell

Exhales a blast of frost that may knock back airborne targets.
%%%%
Cleansing Flame spell

<Cleansing Flame ability>
%%%%
Cloud Cone spell

Blasts the area near the caster with destructive clouds. At low power, the most

become available.

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. Casters are advised to use caution;
the lightning is not mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

Creates a blazing column of flame in a targeted empty location.
%%%%
Controlled Blink spell

Translocates the caster a short distance, with precise control. Be wary that
controlled translocations will cause the subject to become contaminated with

force of any creature it envelops.

bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the

Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left more resilient when the effect ends. It has no effect on those who
are already undead.
%%%%
Debugging Ray spell

Fires a ray which does massive damage (1500 hp) and always hits.
%%%%
Deflect Missiles spell

Protects the caster from all kinds of projectile attacks, making them

cause severe damage, or remove a chunk of rock.
%%%%

anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent. It
causes magical contamination when cast.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

Teleports away any creatures within a short distance of the caster. Any
creature that resists the effect will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a chance of being confused by
the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.

%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon

gnashing teeth are instantly devoured, reinvigorating the caster in their
reptilian rampage. The caster gains innate armour and increased health, and

number of heads is fixed upon casting the spell, and increases with power.

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.

resistant to cold and resistant to poison, but vulnerable to fire.

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures and bypassing any armour
they may have. It heavily deforms its targets, weakening them and reducing
their armour. The caster is not left entirely unaffected; some of the magic
lingers, enough to leave them dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy linked to the caster's own magical
reserves. While the battlesphere cannot take independent action, it will fire
volleys of energy at the caster's enemies in sync with its creator's own
destructive conjurations. With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer
and deals more damage per volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Throws a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The sphere will sometimes
explode on impact, and the chance of it doing so is higher if the sphere has
traveled less distance.

deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is

%%%%
Major Healing spell

Heals a large amount of damage to the caster's body.

unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short

expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster.
%%%%

Mesmerise spell

all those who are not resistant to cold. Those especially vulnerable to cold

entire pack of harpies. With high power the individual creatures will also gain
increased strength.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

Transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal figure. The caster
becomes more resistant to cold and hostile enchantments and completely immune
to poison, rotting, negative energy and torment, and requires no food at all
for the duration of the spell. The caster's necromancy spells are increased in
power, and they gain a draining melee attack. The caster also gains some of the
more dubious benefits of having an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy
damage and Dispel Undead, and an inability to consume potions.

With eight bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything nearby for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%

Envelops the caster's body in a freezing cloud of ice for a short time,
granting a bonus to armour and freezing melee attackers that hit or are blocked.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Drains heat from the caster and their surroundings, causing harm to all
creatures not resistant to cold and bypassing any armour the targets may have.
It prevents the caster from using potions for a brief duration.
%%%%

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The caster
suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

Irresistably prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time,
requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time, but a gateway
will close when entered, or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock.
It takes some time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which they will
be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature. If successful, the target is slowed down for a
while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, the target will
take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Piercing Shot spell

Allows the caster to throw of fire missiles through any targets they hit,
potentially hitting everything in their path until they reach their maximum
distance. These missiles also bypass shields. Each missile thrown or fired
in this way consumes a further 2 MP.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Snake Pit, the Spider Nest,
the Swamp, the Shoals, the Pits of Slime, the Elven Halls, the Vaults, the
Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the specific branch varies
with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. It can
poison even creatures resistant to poison, and the arrow will do some
physical damage.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature poisonous. At high power, the
poisonous cloud will last longer, but it will never last very long.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Allows the caster to teleport fired or thrown missiles directly to their
targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for
each missile. Teleported projectiles have their accuracy greatly increased.
%%%%

pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%

energy, electricity, or acid.
%%%%
Recall spell

Recalls any friendly creatures on the same level to a position adjacent to the
caster, over a short duration.
%%%%
Regeneration spell

Reanimates parts of the caster's wounds. This unnatural act dramatically but
temporarily increases the caster's health regeneration, while also speeding
their metabolism.
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks. Each time a missile is repelled the spell has a chance of
expiring, with a lower chance of expiry at high power.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Ring of Flames spell

Surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of searing flame, and keeps other fire
clouds away from the caster. This spell attunes the caster to the forces of
fire, increasing the power of their fire magic and giving protection from fire.
However, it also makes them much more susceptible to cold.
%%%%
Ring of Thunder spell

Surrounds the caster with a mobile ring of highly-damaging thunderclouds.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Consumes ten stones to create a short blast of high-velocity rock shards. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition may cause the target to lose control over their
magic, progressively hindering their chances of success as more spells are
cast.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. Though
initially mild, so long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and
supplies it with magical power (by waiting in place and not taking any other
actions), the ray will grow in strength until it becomes a surging bolt able to
tear clean through the ranks of the caster's foes.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Shackle spell

Magically chains a creature to the ground, seafloor, or other surface below
it, preventing it from leaving its tile. Unlike paralysis, this does not
prevent the creature from taking other actions, nor does it impair the
creature's evasion.

The shackles are not strong enough to prevent creatures from blinking or
teleporting, but they will follow a creature that does so and bind them to
their new location. Some insubstantial and gelatinous creatures are immune
to this spell.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Shroud of Golubria spell

Bends space around the caster's body, protecting them from some blows by
redirecting their force to the air nearby. Ranged attacks cannot be diverted in
this way. The shroud is highly unstable, and may fall apart unexpectedly under
stress.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Creates an icy replica from the corpse of the original being. This magic is
unstable, so eventually the replica will sublimate into a freezing cloud.
Simulacra cannot leave the level they were created on.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

<Smiting ability>
%%%%
Song of Slaying spell

Recites ancient verses of battle. Each non-summoned enemy the caster slays in
combat during this recitation temporarily enhances their melee and ranged
skills. The bonus only lasts for the duration of the song; casting this spell
while already singing will start a new song, not extend an existing one.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spectral Weapon spell

Draws out the spirit within a wielded weapon to fight for the caster, with its
strength increasing with power. It only attacks when the caster does, and its
kills count as the caster's own. If the weapon is damaged, part of the injury
will be echoed on the caster's body. Only one spectral weapon can be maintained
at a time, and only while the original weapon remains wielded.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be affected, and any abilities that
require evocation skill to trigger will not be active.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

Transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. The caster becomes
highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and casting
spells becomes slightly more difficult.

With three bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and bypasses any armour
the target may have.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

Transforms the caster into a slow but extremely robust stone statue. The
caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially
increased. The caster's stone body is insulated from electricity and gains
resistance to poison, rotting and negative energy.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.

With six bars of power, the effects of this spell last until cancelled.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Sticks to Snakes spell

Transforms a number of arrows in inventory into short-lived snakes, creating
more dangerous snakes with higher power. Each snake costs ten arrows.
%%%%
Sticky Flame Range spell

Launches a glob of sticky flame, covering a targeted creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Conjures a glob of sticky flame, covering an adjacent creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a tornado from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration to
maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Fires a magical dart of poison.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Strip Resistance spell

Greatly reduces the target's magic resistance, making them more vulnerable to
hostile enchantments.

but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%

%%%%
Summon Butterflies spell

Creates a shower of colourful butterflies. How pretty!
%%%%

to serve the caster for a time. The demon's servitude is not guaranteed, but

to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,
and the trees of the forest will be awakened to deal damage to nearby enemies.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster. With
high power, the summoned demon will be less likely to be initially hostile —
but the strongest demons may eventually turn against their summoner regardless.
%%%%
Summon Guardian Golem spell

Summons a protective golem. It redirects the injuries of its allies (but not
the caster) to itself. When sufficiently damaged, it may fill with an inner
flame, causing it to explode if destroyed. It gains more health at high power.

%%%%
Summon Holies spell

of electricity at the caster's foes, but is completely immobile.

significant portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in
their way, but their growth is obstructed by the presence of any creature. They
are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.
%%%%
Tornado spell

Turns the air around the caster into a mighty vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and
tossed around. Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the
caster. The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After
the tornado fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%

and it follows the caster. After the vortex fades, it cannot be called forth
again for a short time.
%%%%
Wall of Brambles spell

Causes brambles to rapidly grow nearby. They have almost no structural
strength, but the wicked thorns they bear make their removal difficult. Such
brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.
