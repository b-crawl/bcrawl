was lost. It induces a bloodthirsty berserker rage in warriors who use it in
battle.

occasionally unleash arcs of chaos upon any creatures nearby, leaving the
wielder unharmed.
%%%%
glaive of Prune

A purple glaive that was created by a mad god, and carries a curse which
transforms anyone wielding it into a prune. Fortunately, the curse works very

purple skin and a few wrinkles.
%%%%
sword of Power

A mighty sword which rewards the powerful with power and the meek with
weakness.
%%%%
staff of Olgreb

A staff which was once wielded by the mighty wizard Olgreb. It increases the

staff of Wucad Mu

A crystal staff overflowing with magical energies. It can be evoked to restore
large amounts of magical energy, but with the risk of damaging the user's mind.
Its power depends on the wielder's Evocations skill.
%%%%
Vampire's Tooth

An ivory-like quick blade that looks like it could have been crafted from the
tooth of some enormous predatory creature. It is lethally vampiric, and
restores a greater portion of life to its user than other vampiric weapons.

A scythe surrounded by an ominous aura of dread. It carries a terrible and
highly irritating curse, which it busily inflicts on both the wielder and their

now thought to be extinct. This prized relic is now one of the last proofs that

# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34

An unerringly vampiric blade which gorges itself on drained life force every
time it strikes.
%%%%
sapphire dagger

A dagger made of one huge shard of sapphire. It covers opponents in ice,

called Boris. He got lost in the Dungeon while seeking the Orb.
%%%%
scythe "Finisher"

A long and exceedingly sharp scythe, capable of eviscerating in a single blow.
Its extraordinary speed is the work of a mad wizard, who spent years refining
it before discarding it in a fit of rage.

The blade looses a low keen as it cuts through the air.
%%%%
sling "Punk"

A sling made of weird green leather, oozing corrosive slime. Originally the
weapon of a notorious mischief-maker and general scamp, it's since fallen into
less savoury hands.
%%%%
longbow "Zephyr"

This bow was woven from the air itself by Eiolaiphi the air mage as a gift for
one of the children of Uskayaw. The bow can be pulled with incredible speed,
and it launches swift and true. It is also nearly indestructible, which is
fortunate given that the original owner was ripped to pieces by jealous
celebrants.
%%%%
giant club "Skullcrusher"

A massive enchanted cudgel that augments the already considerable strength of
anyone mighty enough to wield it.
%%%%
glaive of the Guard

A glaive commissioned several years ago by a wealthy queen fearful for the
safety of her vast treasury. No foe, the smith promised, could defeat a guard
wielding such a weapon!

It was stolen a few months later, along with the rest of the queen's treasury;
the guard, it transpired, had been caught napping. Still, it should serve more
than adequately in the hands of a waking user.
%%%%

A sword made of one huge piece of crystal. Legend says it was the Shining One's
gift to a worshipper. This blade is notorious for inducing bloodthirsty rage in
both the wielder and all of his or her mortal followers.

An unholy crossbow, forged in the fires of Gehenna. It imbues the bolts it
fires with the raw power of its namesake, causing a burst of damnation on

illuminates the dungeon's recesses, revealing the machinations of those who

harder it will be to find a worthy opponent.
%%%%
Spriggan's Knife

A dainty little knife which was made by Spriggans, or for Spriggans, or
possibly from Spriggans. Anyway, it's in some way associated with those fey
folk. It carves into the world of dreams, and stabs any unaware enemy as if it
were asleep.
%%%%
plutonium sword

A triple sword made of weird glowing metal. It irradiates those it strikes,
causing a range of unpredictable effects — if they survive the impact of the
blade itself, that is.
%%%%
great mace "Undeadhunter"

creatures together. Legends say that, long ago, a lich lord created many
such weapons to ensure the loyalty of his undead servants. Sadly, this mace
might be the last one left.

A double-ended whip made from the cured hides of black mambas, and enchanted

Lehudib's crystal spear

Presumably this relic led to the invention of the famous spell, or maybe the
other way around.

large shield of Ignorance

A shield unearthed from the remains of a ruined city. It bears an inscription

hours to decipher it, and in time, a translation was finally settled on:

"With a shield like this, who needs to think?"

%%%%
crown of Dyrovepreva

A large circlet of dull bronze, set with a dazzling array of gemstones. It was

A well-made golden hauberk that covers all of its wearer's body parts. It
includes a chainmail coif, chausses and maille gauntlets.

%%%%
salamander hide armour

Most salamanders' bodies are consigned to the fiery depths from which they
sprang. Rarely, though, salamanders instead preserve the skins of those that
passed. The runes and decorations on this hide suggest it once belonged to a
respected warrior or priest - perhaps even a king.

gauntlets of War

A pair of thick steel gauntlets. They were Okawaru's reward for a mighty
warlord. The owner is destined to die in battle, but what a death it will be!
%%%%
shield of Resistance

by the adherents of an obscure minor faith, who imbued it with the power of

robe of Folly

A dull grey robe. It is enchanted to provide its wearer with immeasurable power
and wisdom, but...
%%%%
Maxwell's patent armour

A suit of armour created by the famous inventor Maxwell, providing unparalleled
protective qualities at a very affordable price. His unorthodox materials left
it with certain shortcomings, but he's yet to have anyone come back for a
refund.
%%%%
mask of the Dragon

The mask of the High Priest of ancient Erebora. In ancient times, the gods of
the Ereborans ceased to answer their prayers, and in desperation, the people
turned to the forbidden worship of dragons. Now, of their works, only this mask
remains.
%%%%
robe of Night

A long black robe made of strange glossy material. It shrouds its wearer in

of Ratri the Goddess of the Night to one of her followers.
%%%%
scales of the Dragon King

A suit of armour created from the enchanted scales of a once-mighty king of
dragons. In his time, titans and lesser dragons struggled with him in vain —
but as with all things, even he was eventually cast down and undone. Of his
life and deeds, this is all that remains.
%%%%
hat of the Alchemist

A dirty hat. It bears signs of surviving many weird explosions, which suggests
it may have means of protecting the head inside from the risks involved with

A cloak stitched from the hides of hundreds of hell rats, by an enchantress

%%%%
shield of the Gong

A heavy bronze gong that can be worn as a shield. According to some mystics,
beating on such a gong can grant the wearer spiritual protection.

A sky-blue amulet. It must have been given its many protective properties by a
powerful air mage, although it seems the one thing they lacked was a steady
hand.

umbra that surrounds the wearer and increases stealth greatly, and reduces the

A strange-looking piece of crystal on an ordinary-looking string, with an odd

and folds can be swirled into a furious storm.

protect against the desiccating effects of salt.

so that unsuspecting adventurers would unleash demons into this world. Beware,
for it has ways of taking its wielder under its command...

crackling with electricity, they have been enchanted to allow their wearer to
slither at almost a human's pace.
%%%%
Black Knight's horse barding

A heavy barding made from pitch-black steel and inlaid with plates of black
diamond. It once protected the steed of the Black Knight during his reign of
terror. Those who wear it become partially undead, gaining some of the benefits
without the unfortunate downsides, although the great weight of metal and stone
slows the wearer somewhat.
%%%%
amulet of Vitality

A jewelled amulet famed for its powers of resilience and recuperation. Its
greatest notoriety came from its use by the dread necromancer Borgnjor, who
relied upon it to maintain her slender hold on life. After her final demise,
the amulet vanished from the pages of history.

An exquisitely crafted sword, enchanted to provide both mental and physical
strength to the wielder.

shillelagh "Devastator"

to exhibit strength far beyond its capabilities, and your movements become
guided by Makhleb.
%%%%
moon troll leather armour

A suit of armour rumoured to have been created by enchanting the hide of a
now-extinct species of troll. Whether the name rings true or is merely
appropriated to add mystique is something of a mystery. The armour's innate
powers of regeneration and magical protection, however, are hard to dispute.
%%%%
macabre finger necklace

An ugly dangling finger on a string. It would look better with a ring on it.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
boots of the spider

A novel pair of boots invented by a suitor of Arachne.
%%%%
dark maul

A large, iron-shod maul specialised for dealing massively powerful blows. Such
power comes at a price: the maul's head is so heavy it takes a great length of
time to lift it up for another swing.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
hat of the High Council

A relic of some ancient wizarding war. Centuries later, it still crackles with
effects from the residual hexes and magical energies it was once subjected to
on a daily basis; spellcasters able to get a handle on its power, however, will
find it enhances the power of their spells.
%%%%
arc blade

A blade somehow crafted from pure electricity. Striking an enemy with it
occasionally unleashes powerful arcs of lightning.

These may arc to other adjacent creatures, or back to the wielder, before
eventually grounding out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the wielder,
and bypasses any armour the target may have.
%%%%
demon whip "Spellbinder"

A weapon said to have once been used to keep unruly imprisoned wizards in line;
it violently disrupts their ability to use magic, inflicting wild and
unpredictable magical effects on those it strikes.
%%%%
lajatang of Order

A silver-bladed lajatang, once bestowed upon a favoured worshipper of Zin. It
became the most prized weapon of the many priests of Zin. After their order was

A huge mace imbued with potent fire magic. It fills those it strikes with
inner flame, and offers protection against the resulting devastation as well
as immunity to clouds of flame.
%%%%
orange crystal plate armour

A suit of armour carved from transparent orange crystal. It provides remarkable
protection for both mind and body. The wearer can even channel psychic energies
through the crystal itself, enhancing their magical abilities. However, it's
rather heavy...
%%%%
Majin-Bo

A staff inhabited by a mighty demon, tricked and trapped in this form long
ago. To survive, she now offers tremendous arcane power at a small price: a
tiny portion of the caster's life essence, taken alongside the magic used every
time its wielder casts a spell.
%%%%
pair of quick blades "Gyre" and "Gimble"

Two quick blades joined by a chain. Swinging one compels the wielder to swing
the other, as if they have minds of their own.
%%%%
Maxwell's etheric cage

A fine mesh cage designed to capture magical energy. Experimental notes suggest
that research was abandoned when the cage began to capture magical
contamination almost as effectively. Anyone reckless enough to place it on
their head would find their magic regeneration dramatically increased, at the
cost of multiplying any magical contamination received.
%%%%
# TAG_MAJOR_VERSION == 34
crown of Eternal Torment

A gold crown set with jet-black gems. It permanently afflicts its wearer with
agonising pain, substantially reducing their resilience but rendering them
immune to further torments.

A robe woven of living vines. The vines form a symbiotic relationship with
their wearer, greatly increasing their regeneration, but preventing them from
being healed by potions.
%%%%
Kryia's mail coat

A coat of armour said to have been forged for Queen Kryia in her old age. She
continued to insist on leading her armies from the front even into her dotage,
and as her aging body failed her, this coat helped to enhance the healing
draughts that kept her alive. The wearer of this garment will have
significantly increased healing from potions.
%%%%
frozen axe "Frostbite"

A massive axe that looks like it was carved from a glacier, or possibly calved
from one. It leaves ice crystals in its wake as it swings through the air, and

armour of Talos

A huge and weighty suit of bronze plate armour. Only one with a correspondingly
huge body can wear it.
%%%%
warlock's mirror

A handheld array of hexagonal mirrors, synthesized from a truly exotic
substance and polished to a blinding sheen. A skilled user will find that it
can reflect almost anything, even spells that pierce through lesser materials
and hexes with no physical manifestation at all.
%%%%
amulet of invisibility

An amulet that can be activated to render its wearer invisible.
%%%%
Maxwell's thermic engine

A strange sword, one blade blistering hot and the other icy cold. When it hits
its target the thermal gradient increases. What causes this effect is unknown
but it is rumored that otherworldly forces are involved.
%%%%
hand wraps "Fists of Thunder"

A simple set of hand wraps, cracking with electricity. Unlike most gloves they
don't cover any claws the wearer has, and they can deliver a real shock to
anyone on the receiving end of a punch.
